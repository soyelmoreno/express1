    "description": "Improved Performance The new generation Butterfly Kiss shaver comes with an improved design and unbeatable performance. Made of best in class materials the shaver was produced using technically advanced equipment and production facilities. The large flexing rotary blades allow covering large areas of the body on a single pass. The strong casing ensures maximum protection and durable use for your shaver. Shave in the Shower The Butterfly Kiss is enriched with IPX5 water resistance technology. Being water resistant it simplifies the shaving process, allowing to use the shaver in the shower, as well as rinsing it under running water. It is up to you to choose the way you shave: wet or dry shave, with or without shaving foam, gel or soap. Butterfly Kiss offers a perfectly clean shave and exceptionally excellent results no matter which option you choose. 5-head Forte Blade The Butterfly Kiss shaver comes with a 5-head Forte blade. The pivoting rotary heads of the blade easily flex to adjust to the contours of your body to ensure an efficient and close shave. Thanks to the supreme quality materials and re-engineered blade design, you will experience an exceptionally fast and safe shave within a few minutes. Shave Anytime, Anywhere, with No Mess Due to the high-performance lithium-ion battery (600 mAh), the Butterfly Kiss offers 60 minutes of cordless operation allowing to shave whenever and wherever you want. The women’s shaver also perfectly works in \"plug and shave\" mode. Butterfly Kiss is a must-have for women who tend to travel frequently as it is an excellent solution for shaving on the go: the in-built vacuum technology collects all the hair within the shaver and ensures a mess-free shaving experience. No Nicks. No Cuts. The pivoting neck adjusts to the contours and curves of your body ensuring a perfect shave without causing any skin irritation, nicks and cuts. The ergonomic handle allows easy manipulation of the shaver adjusting to the shape of your body without missing any single hair. The new innovated Butterfly Kiss offers exceptional flexibility resulting in unbeatable performance and outstanding results. LED Battery Life Indicator Butterfly Kiss women’s shaver is equipped with a LED light indicator to show the battery charge level. This lets you know when exactly the shaver needs to be recharged. The indicator is green when the shaver is charged and turns red once the battery runs low. The performance of the shaver remains steadily strong until fully discharged.

    "description": "The CR-3 Blade Skull Shaver 3 head Carver PRO blades are perfectly suited for both head and face shaving. The smaller blade profile more closely conforms to tightly contoured areas such as your chin or jawline. Experience the exceptionally close and safe shave thanks to the re-engineered Carver PRO blades made of premium Japanese Stainless Steel to ensure flawless results. Carver PRO features dual cutting rings and flat foil mesh. Carver is recommended for coarse hair. The upgraded 3 head PRO blades have several advantages over 5 head designs and are great for covering a lot of area in a small amount of time: Shave Faster Skull Shaver PRO next-generation 3 head blades let you shave faster than our previous designs. Multi-directional rotary shaving heads let you shave in any direction. Shave up, down, left, right, whatever works best for you and for best results, we recommend shaving in small circular motions. Skull Shaver PRO blades have more cutting edges per shaving head than our previous generation blades, giving you 20% more cutting action per rotation. All this means a faster and closer shave and a perfect look everyday. Exceptional Contouring 3 head PRO blades contour and perfectly adjust to your head and face while shaving: each blade floats independently, allowing 360° of contouring and each floating blade is mounted in a flexing head that automatically adjusts for tighter or larger curves. This flexibility gives you better and even more coverage, so you don't have to keep going over trouble spots. Faster shave with no irritation! Superior Performance Skull Shaver PRO blades are made from premium hypo-allergenic Japanese stainless steel, which has the ability to provide and hold an extremely sharp edge while providing a long lifetime. Keeping the precision blades clean will provide you with the best performance and the longest blade lifetime. No Irritation Another great advantage of the newest PRO blades is extremely safe shave without any skin irritation. One of the biggest sources of irritation is pressing too hard. Skull Shaver PRO blades are spring-loaded and will fully retract into the housing if pressed too hard. The springs keep the perfect amount of pressure against your skin, greatly reducing irritation. If you do press too hard, the shaver will also slow down, giving you an audible reminder to lower the shaving pressure. Deeper Cleaning The availability of deeper cleaning extends blade life and keeps your shaves as smooth as day one. Removable PRO blades come off in a snap making it easy to give your blades a deep clean inside and out. Less Mess Due to the built-in vacuum technology, Skull Shaver PRO blades capture hair inside their large shaving chambers. Hair stays off your skin and shirt so you can always have a clean shave and look your best wherever you go. Built Stronger The all-new 3 head PRO blades by Skull Shaver are built stronger than any of our previous designs: the blades are suspended in a two-piece chassis to allow contouring flexibility while holding them securely in place. The drivetrain has been relocated to a sealed chamber to keep hair clippings out of the transmission, ensuring you always get consistent and smooth performance. Shave Wet or Dry Next-generation PRO blades work great for shaving both wet and dry. For wet shave use shaving cream, foam, or oil. We recommend wet shaving with shaving cream for the smoothest shave possible. Compatibility Upgraded 3 head PRO blades are compatible with all Pitbull, Palm, and Butterfly Kiss shavers. Find the style that suits you best We make Skull Shaver PRO blades in three styles: Carver, Forte, and Baron. If you had a favourite in our 5 head, you can simply choose the same style PRO blade. Carver features dual cutting rings and flat foil mesh. Carver is recommended for coarse hair. Forte features dual cutting rings and bevelled foil mesh. Cutting performance between Carver and Forte is similar, although Forte will feel smoother as it glides across your skin due to the curved and bevelled foils. Forte is our most popular and is the best choice for most people. Baron features three cutting rings per shaving head: two with S-shaped openings, and one cutting ring with dots.

The smaller blade profile more closely conforms to tightly contoured areas such as your chin or jawline. Experience the exceptionally close and safe shave thanks to the re-engineered Carver PRO blades made of premium Japanese Stainless Steel to ensure flawless results. Carver PRO features dual cutting rings and flat foil mesh. Carver is recommended for coarse hair. The upgraded 3 head PRO blades have several advantages over 5 head designs and are great for covering a lot of area in a small amount of time:</span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"alternating-row\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col-sm-3 col-sm-push-9 image-block\"><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0264/8486/7181/files/craver3_9fc45fcf-b86f-46ad-8731-ea036a5335ec_480x480.png?v=1575282838\" alt=\"\"></div>\n<div class=\"col-sm-9 col-sm-pull-3 image-block\">\n<h3>Shave Faster</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Skull Shaver PRO next-generation 3 head blades let you shave faster than our previous designs. Multi-directional rotary shaving heads let you shave in any direction. Shave up, down, left, right, whatever works best for you and for best results, we recommend shaving in small circular motions. Skull Shaver PRO blades have more cutting edges per shaving head than our previous generation blades, giving you 20% more cutting action per rotation. All this means a faster and closer shave and a perfect look everyday.</span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"alternating-row\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col-sm-3 image-block\"><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0264/8486/7181/files/carver-pro_480x480.png?v=1575282954\" alt=\"palm shaver and nose hair trimmer\"></div>\n<div class=\"col-sm-9\">\n<h3>Exceptional Contouring</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">3 head PRO blades contour and perfectly adjust to your head and face while shaving: each blade floats independently, allowing 360° of contouring and each floating blade is mounted in a flexing head that automatically adjusts for tighter or larger curves. This flexibility gives you better and even more coverage, so you don't have to keep going over trouble spots. Faster shave with no irritation! </span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"alternating-row\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col-sm-3 col-sm-push-9 image-block\"><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0264/8486/7181/files/Craver-blade_480x480.png?v=1575282747\" alt=\"palm shaver easy cleanup\"></div>\n<div class=\"col-sm-9 col-sm-pull-3 image-block\">\n<h3>Superior Performance</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Skull Shaver PRO blades are made from premium hypo-allergenic Japanese stainless steel, which has the ability to provide and hold an extremely sharp edge while providing a long lifetime. Keeping the precision blades clean will provide you with the best performance and the longest blade lifetime. </span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"alternating-row\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col-sm-3 image-block\"><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0264/8486/7181/files/carver_pro_1_807b1cfa-7d01-4aa4-bb3d-fd6a0600afe0_480x480.jpg?v=1574250552%20alt=\"></div>\n<div class=\"col-sm-9\">\n<h3>No Irritation</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Another great advantage of the newest PRO blades is extremely safe shave without any skin irritation. One of the biggest sources of irritation is pressing too hard. Skull Shaver PRO blades are spring-loaded and will fully retract into the housing if pressed too hard. The springs keep the perfect amount of pressure against your skin, greatly reducing irritation. If you do press too hard, the shaver will also slow down, giving you an audible reminder to lower the shaving pressure.</span></p>\n<div class=\"col-sm-9\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"alternating-row\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col-sm-3 col-sm-push-9 image-block\"><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0264/8486/7181/files/3-head-opened_1_480x480.png?v=1575282904\" alt=\"\"></div>\n<div class=\"col-sm-9 col-sm-pull-3 image-block\">\n<h3>Deeper Cleaning</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">The availability of deeper cleaning extends blade life and keeps your shaves as smooth as day one. Removable PRO blades come off in a snap making it easy to give your blades a deep clean inside and out.</span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"alternating-row\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col-sm-3 image-block\"><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0264/8486/7181/files/craver3_9fc45fcf-b86f-46ad-8731-ea036a5335ec_480x480.png?v=1575282838\" alt=\"palm shaver cordless operation\"></div>\n<div class=\"col-sm-9\">\n<h3>Less Mess</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Due to the built-in vacuum technology, Skull Shaver PRO blades capture hair inside their large shaving chambers. Hair stays off your skin and shirt so you can always have a clean shave and look your best wherever you go.</span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"alternating-row\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col-sm-3 col-sm-push-9 image-block\"><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0264/8486/7181/files/Craver-blade_480x480.png?v=1575282747\" alt=\"\"></div>\n<div class=\"col-sm-9 col-sm-pull-3 image-block\">\n<h3>Built Stronger</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">The all-new 3 head PRO blades by Skull Shaver are built stronger than any of our previous designs: the blades are suspended in a two-piece chassis to allow contouring flexibility while holding them securely in place. The drivetrain has been relocated to a sealed chamber to keep hair clippings out of the transmission, ensuring you always get consistent and smooth performance.</span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"alternating-row\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col-sm-3 image-block\"><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0264/8486/7181/files/proWetShave_web_720x_38cd8054-e797-42d4-ba27-d546a1111c64_480x480.jpg?v=1574082259\" alt=\"palm shaver and nose hair trimmer\"></div>\n<div class=\"col-sm-9\">\n<h3>Shave Wet or Dry</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Next-generation PRO blades work great for shaving both wet and dry. For wet shave use shaving cream, foam, or oil. We recommend wet shaving with shaving cream for the smoothest shave possible.</span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"alternating-row\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col-sm-3 col-sm-push-9 image-block\"><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0264/8486/7181/files/craver3_9fc45fcf-b86f-46ad-8731-ea036a5335ec_480x480.png?v=1575282838\" alt=\"palm shaver easy cleanup\"></div>\n<div class=\"col-sm-9 col-sm-pull-3 image-block\">\n<h3>Compatibility</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Upgraded 3 head PRO blades are compatible with all Pitbull, Palm, and Butterfly Kiss shavers.</span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"alternating-row\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col-sm-3 image-block\"><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0264/8486/7181/files/proBladeComparison_web_1_480x480.png?v=1574163052\" alt=\"\"></div>\n<div class=\"col-sm-9\">\n<h3>Find the style that suits you best</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">We make Skull Shaver PRO blades in three styles: Carver, Forte, and Baron. If you had a favourite in our 5 head, you can simply choose the same style PRO blade. Carver features dual cutting rings and flat foil mesh. Carver is recommended for coarse hair. Forte features dual cutting rings and bevelled foil mesh. Cutting performance between Carver and Forte is similar, although Forte will feel smoother as it glides across your skin due to the curved and bevelled foils. Forte is our most popular and is the best choice for most people. Baron features three cutting rings per shaving head: two with S-shaped openings, and one cutting ring with dots. Those with sensitive skin and fine hair will love this style.</span></p>\n<p><br></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/bV2QaBF3_Qs\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n",

    "description": "Signature innovative handle Our Palm shavers have a unique innovative design and are equipped with our signature ergonomic handle that fits perfectly in the palm of your hand. Such an easy and comfortable grip gives more freedom and flexibility of movement that allows better access to hard to reach areas of your head. You can either hold the shaver between your fingers for an intuitive and convenient head shaving or grab the handle with your hand for a smooth and close shave of your face. Such an innovative approach allows you to save time and effort and bring the shaving to a whole new level. Ultra-precision blade Our Palm shaver is equipped with a CR-3 Blade designed with 3 unique large flexing and pivoting heads that ensure efficient close shaving for all types of skin. Each of the three rotary heads of the CR-3 Blade flexes independently allowing a close and precise cut in all areas of head and face. Cordless operation The shaver is equipped with a powerful integrated lithium-ion battery that provides up to 60 minutes cordless usage on a single charge. This gives you the freedom to shave anywhere and anytime at you prefer. This also makes the Palm Shaver very handy for travelers who often need a quick shave on the go. The shaver is also safe to be used in plug and shave mode just in case you forgot to charge it. Water resistance technology The Palm electric men’s head and face shaver uses IPX5 technology and is water resistant giving you the freedom and convenience of shaving in the shower (please do not submerge the shaver). Ear/Nose trimmer attachment The Palm shaver comes with an ear/nose trimmer attachment. The ear/nose trimmer will help you get rid of unwanted hair in delicate areas without pain, pulling, or pinching. By choosing the Palm shaver, you are sure to get the most complete and efficient shaving kit to use every day. Easy cleaning Thanks to the built-in vacuum system all the hair is collected within the shaver to ensure fast and easy cleaning. To clean the CR-3 blade, simply open it up and hold it under running water to remove all the hair. Alternatively, use the Skull Shaver Rinse Stand (sold separately) or simply immerse the blades of the shaver into warm water while on. For best results and performance we advise cleaning the blades regularly.",

Forte blade included: Made for Head Shaving Face Shaving Experience the exceptional close and safe shave thanks to the re-engineered PRO blades made of premium Japanese Stainless Steel to ensure flawless results. The upgraded Pitbull PRO blades have several advantages over 5 head designs and are great for covering a lot of area in a small amount of time. Shave Faster Skull Shaver PRO blades let you shave faster than our previous designs. Multi directional rotary shaving heads let you shave in any direction. Shave up, down, left, right, whatever works best for you. For best results we recommend shaving in small circular motions. Skull Shaver PRO blades have more blades per shaving head than our previous generation blades, giving you 20% more cutting action per rotation. All this means a faster shave so you can get on with life. Exceptional Contouring Skull Shaver PRO contours specifically to your head or face while you shave. Each blade floats independently, allowing 360° of contouring. Each floating blade is mounted in a flexing head that automatically adjusts for tighter or larger curves. Combined this flexibility gives you better, more even coverage so you don't have to keep going over trouble spots. Faster shave, less irritation. Superior Performance Skull Shaver PRO blades are made from premium hypo-allergenic Japanese stainless steel.

If you do press too hard, the shaver will also slow down, giving you an audible reminder to lower the shaving pressure. Deeper Cleaning Removable blades come off in a snap making it easy to give your blades a deep clean inside and out. Keeping your blades clean will greatly extend blade life and keep your shaves as smooth as day 1. Less Mess Skull Shaver PRO blades are designed to capture hair shavings inside their large shaving chambers. Hair stays off your skin and shirt so you can always have a clean shave and look your best wherever you go. Built Stronger The all new Skull Shaver PRO blades are built stronger than any of our previous designs. The blades are suspended in a two-piece chassis to allow contouring flexibility while holding them securely in place. The drivetrain has been relocated to a sealed chamber to keep hair clippings out of the transmission, ensuring you always get consistent and smooth performance. Shave Wet or Dry Skull Shaver PRO blades work great when shaving wet or dry. Shave with shaving cream, foam, or oil. We recommend wet shaving with shaving cream for the smoothest shave possible.

Multi directional rotary shaving heads let you shave in any direction. Shave up, down, left, right, whatever works best for you. For best results we recommend shaving in small circular motions. Skull Shaver PRO blades have more blades per shaving head than our previous generation blades, giving you 20% more cutting action per rotation. All this means a faster shave so you can get on with life.</span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"alternating-row\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col-sm-3 col-sm-push-9 image-block\"><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0264/8486/7181/files/US-SILVER-FLEXIBLE.JPG?v=1583479771\" alt=\"skull shaver pro 360 degree contouring\"></div>\n<div class=\"col-sm-9 col-sm-pull-3 image-block\">\n<h3>Exceptional Contouring</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Skull Shaver PRO contours specifically to your head or face while you shave. Each blade floats independently, allowing 360° of contouring. Each floating blade is mounted in a flexing head that automatically adjusts for tighter or larger curves. Combined this flexibility gives you better, more even coverage so you don't have to keep going over trouble spots. Faster shave, less irritation.</span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"alternating-row\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col-sm-3 image-block\"><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0264/8486/7181/files/US-GOLD-BEVELED.JPG?v=1583479771\" alt=\"skull shaver carver pro blade premium stainless steel\"></div>\n<div class=\"col-sm-9\">\n<h3>Superior Performance</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Skull Shaver PRO blades are made from premium hypo-allergenic Japanese stainless steel. The steel was specifically chosen for its ability to provide and hold an extremely sharp edge while providing a long lifetime. Keeping the precision blades clean will provide you the longest blade lifetime and best performance.</span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"alternating-row\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col-sm-3 col-sm-push-9 image-block\"><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0264/8486/7181/files/US-PLATINUM-IRRITATION.JPG?v=1583479771\" alt=\"skull shaver PRO blades protect against irritation\"></div>\n<div class=\"col-sm-9 col-sm-pull-3 image-block\">\n<h3>Less Irritation</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">One of the biggest sources of irritation is pressing too hard. Skull Shaver PRO blades are spring loaded and will fully retract into the housing if pressed too hard. The springs keep the perfect amount of pressure against your skin, greatly reducing irritation. If you do press too hard, the shaver will also slow down, giving you an audible reminder to lower the shaving pressure.</span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"alternating-row\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col-sm-3 image-block\"><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0264/8486/7181/files/US-PLATINUM-EASY.jpg?v=1583479771\" alt=\"skull shaver pro blades seperate for easy cleaning\"></div>\n<div class=\"col-sm-9\">\n<h3>Deeper Cleaning</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Removable blades come off in a snap making it easy to give your blades a deep clean inside and out.

If you had a favorite in our 5 head, you can simply choose the same style PRO blade. Carver features dual cutting rings and flat foil mesh. Carver is recommended for coarse hair. Forte features dual cutting rings and beveled foil mesh. Cutting performance between Carver and Forte is similar, although Forte will feel smoother as it glides across your skin due to the curved and beveled foils. Forte is our most popular and is the best choice for most people. Baron features three cutting rings per shaving head: two with S shaped openings, and one cutting ring with dots. Those with sensitive skin and fine hair will love this style.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"videoAutoPlayEmbed\">\n<div class=\"embed-container\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DC1BCzKmusk?rel=0&amp;autoplay=1&amp;mute=1&amp;version=3&amp;loop=1&amp;playlist=DC1BCzKmusk\" allowfullscreen=\"y\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></div>\n</div>",

    "description": "Skull Shaver Gold PRO: Available only in European and Australian markets. Innovative design for maximum comfort A reinvented and remastered design with the use of best in class materials to offer unconventional comfort during shaving. Skull Shaver Gold PRO is equipped with our signature patented innovative ergonomic handle which offers easy grip and perfectly fits your hand to ensure comfortable and intuitive shaving of your head and face. Thanks to the unique design the shaver easily gets to all tough to reach areas ensuring impeccable results. The Skull Shaver Gold PRO is similar to our Pitbull Gold PRO, but with a different logo on the front. This model is only available in European and Australian markets. Professional performance Discover the fourth generation of Skull Shaver products with improved design and unbeatable performance. The new Skull Shaver Gold PRO is made of high quality materials using technically advanced equipment and production facilities. The shaver comes with our all new PRO blade design: a radical new design from Skull Shaver that promises the best performance and longevity yet. Wet Shave in the Shower Skull Shaver Gold PRO electric shaver uses IPX5 technology and is water resistant giving you the freedom and convenience of shaving in the shower, as well as easily rinsing your shaver under the running water. Naturally, Skull Shaver men shavers are also perfectly adapted for dry shaving offering high quality close shave and exceptional results. Skull Shaver Gold PRO gives you the freedom to shave the way you prefer. Wet or dry, with shaving foam or without. The results are impeccable each time. Shave Anytime, Anywhere, with No Mess Our electric head shavers were invented for travel and have it deep in their DNA. The Skull Shaver Gold PRO electric head shaver lets you shave comfortably wet or dry, so you can shave anytime and anywhere. The blade design captures hair clippings inside the shaving chambers and off your skin and shirt. Keep one in your car, office, or private jet for a quick shave on the go. No Nicks. No Cuts. The rotary shaving heads make fast work of your stubble, allowing you to safely shave in any direction. No more painful nicks, stinging cuts, or raised scars that keep getting knicked. Our rotary shaving heads glide smoothly over irregularities and have won over customers with trouble areas due to birthmarks, freckles, scars, or those who simply cannot afford to break the skin. 90 minutes of cordless use Skull Shaver Gold PRO electric shaver is equipped with powerful integrated lithium-ion battery (1400 mAh) which allows quick charging and 90 minutes of cordless use. This gives you the freedom to shave anywhere and anytime at your convenience. This also makes Skull Shaver Gold a must-have for travelers who often need a quick shave on the go. The shaver also perfectly works in plug and shave mode: a great alternative in case you forgot to charge it. Battery life indicator Know exactly when your shaver should be charged. The integrated LED illuminated LCD display clearly shows the battery level in percentages to make the daily use of your shaver even more practical. The performance of the shaver remains steadily strong until fully discharged. Forte Blade included for Head and Face Shaving The included Forte blade for your Skull Shaver Gold PRO shaver allows you to shave your head or face wet or dry. Experience the exceptional close and safe shave thanks to the re-engineered PRO blades made of premium Japanese Stainless Steel to ensure flawless results. The upgraded Skull Shaver PRO blades have several advantages over 5 head designs and are great for covering a lot of area in a small amount of time. Shave Faster Skull Shaver PRO blades let you shave faster than our previous designs. Multi directional rotary shaving heads let you shave in any direction. Shave up, down, left, right, whatever works best for you. For best results we recommend shaving in small circular motions. Skull Shaver PRO blades have more blades per shaving head than our previous generation blades, giving you 20% more cutting action per rotation. All this means a faster shave so you can get on with life. Exceptional Contouring Skull Shaver PRO contours specifically to your head or face while you shave. Each blade floats independently, allowing 360° of contouring. Each floating blade is mounted in a flexing head that automatically adjusts for tighter or larger curves. Combined this flexibility gives you better, more even coverage so you don't have to keep going over trouble spots. Faster shave, less irritation. Superior Performance Skull Shaver PRO blades are made from premium hypo-allergenic Japanese stainless steel. The steel was specifically chosen for its ability to provide and hold an extremely sharp edge while providing a long lifetime. Keeping the precision blades clean will provide you the longest blade lifetime and best performance. Less Irritation One of the biggest sources of irritation is pressing too hard. Skull Shaver PRO blades are spring loaded and will fully retract into the housing if pressed too hard. The springs keep the perfect amount of pressure against your skin, greatly reducing irritation. If you do press too hard, the shaver will also slow down, giving you an audible reminder to lower the shaving pressure. Deeper Cleaning Removable blades come off in a snap making it easy to give your blades a deep clean inside and out. Keeping your blades clean will greatly extend blade life and keep your shaves as smooth as day 1. Less Mess Skull Shaver PRO blades are designed to capture hair shavings inside their large shaving chambers. Hair stays off your skin and shirt so you can always have a clean shave and look your best wherever you go. Built Stronger The all new Skull Shaver PRO blades are built stronger than any of our previous designs. The blades are suspended in a two-piece chassis to allow contouring flexibility while holding them securely in place. The drivetrain has been relocated to a sealed chamber to keep hair clippings out of the transmission, ensuring you always get consistent and smooth performance. Shave Wet or Dry Skull Shaver PRO blades work great when shaving wet or dry. Shave with shaving cream, foam, or oil. We recommend wet shaving with shaving cream for the smoothest shave possible. Compatibility Skull Shaver PRO blades are compatible with all Skull Shaver, Palm, and Butterfly Kiss shavers. Find the style that suits you best We make Skull Shaver PRO blades in three styles: Carver, Forte, and Baron. If you had a favorite in our 5 head, you can simply choose the same style PRO blade. Carver features dual cutting rings and flat foil mesh. Carver is recommended for coarse hair. Forte features dual cutting rings and beveled foil mesh. Cutting performance between Carver and Forte is similar, although Forte will feel smoother as it glides across your skin due to the curved and beveled foils. Forte is our most popular and is the best choice for most people. Baron features three cutting rings per shaving head: two with S shaped openings, and one cutting ring with dots. Those with sensitive skin and fine hair will love this style.",

    "description": "Skull Shaver PRO: Faster. Smoother. Stronger. Shave Faster Skull Shaver PRO blades let you shave faster than our previous designs. Multi directional rotary shaving heads let you shave in any direction. Shave up, down, left, right, whatever works best for you. For best results we recommend shaving in small circular motions. Skull Shaver PRO blades have more blades per shaving head than our previous generation blades, giving you 20% more cutting action per rotation. All this means a faster shave so you can get on with life. Exceptional Contouring Skull Shaver PRO contours specifically to your head or face while you shave. Each blade floats independently, allowing 360° of contouring. Each floating blade is mounted in a flexing head that automatically adjusts for tighter or larger curves. Combined this flexibility gives you better, more even coverage so you don't have to keep going over trouble spots. Faster shave, less irritation. Superior Performance Skull Shaver PRO blades are made from premium hypo-allergenic Japanese stainless steel. The steel was specifically chosen for its ability to provide and hold an extremely sharp edge while providing a long lifetime. Keeping the precision blades clean will provide you the longest blade lifetime and best performance. Less Irritation One of the biggest sources of irritation is pressing too hard. Skull Shaver PRO blades are spring loaded and will fully retract into the housing if pressed too hard. The springs keep the perfect amount of pressure against your skin, greatly reducing irritation. If you do press too hard, the shaver will also slow down, giving you an audible reminder to lower the shaving pressure. Deeper Cleaning Removable blades come off in a snap making it easy to give your blades a deep clean inside and out. Keeping your blades clean will greatly extend blade life and keep your shaves as smooth as day 1. Less Mess Skull Shaver PRO blades are designed to capture hair shavings inside their large shaving chambers. Hair stays off your skin and shirt so you can always have a clean shave and look your best wherever you go. Built Stronger The all new Skull Shaver PRO blades are built stronger than any of our previous designs. The blades are suspended in a two-piece chassis to allow contouring flexibility while holding them securely in place. The drivetrain has been relocated to a sealed chamber to keep hair clippings out of the transmission, ensuring you always get consistent and smooth performance. Shave Wet or Dry Skull Shaver PRO blades work great when shaving wet or dry. Shave with shaving cream, foam, or oil. We recommend wet shaving with shaving cream for the smoothest shave possible. Compatibility Skull Shaver PRO blades are compatible with all Pit bull, Palm, and Butterfly Kiss shavers. Find the style that suits you best We make Skull Shaver PRO blades in three styles: Carver, Forte, and Baron. If you had a favorite in our 5 head, you can simply choose the same style PRO blade. Carver features dual cutting rings and flat foil mesh. Carver is recommended for coarse hair. Forte features dual cutting rings and beveled foil mesh. Cutting performance between Carver and Forte is similar, although Forte will feel smoother as it glides across your skin due to the curved and beveled foils. Forte is our most popular and is the best choice for most people. Baron features three cutting rings per shaving head: two with S shaped openings, and one cutting ring with dots. Those with sensitive skin and fine hair will love this style.",
